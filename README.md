The Tao of Haiku.

A Neural Network that generates unlimited Haiku on Twitter.

Inspired by the brilliant examples by Andrej Karpathy on ["The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks"](http://karpathy.github.io/2015/05/21/rnn-effectiveness/)

Large portions of the code adapted from Alex Black's [LSTM examples](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/rnn/GravesLSTMCharModellingExample.java)
